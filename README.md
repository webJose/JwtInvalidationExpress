# JwtInvalidationExpress

> NodeJS Express server that exemplifies how to invalidate JWT's by their "issued at" claim value.

## Purpose

This is a sample Express HTTP server that demonstrates how to invalidate JSON web tokens by its creation time 
(a. k. a. its `iat` claim).

It uses **ES Modules** and modern JavaScript syntax.  While I did not test, it probably works with NodeJS v16 and 
above, but in all honesty, I have only ever run it in NodeJS v18.

Read [this article]() for a detailed explanation of how all this works.

Have fun!
