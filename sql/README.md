The example uses a MySQL table to maintain the JWT invalidation records.  This folder contains the necessary SQL to 
create the single table consumed.

**NOTE**:  You are responsible to create the database and a suitable username (with a corresponding password) for the 
application to be able to read and write data to this table.
